Here’s a detailed summary of your chat session for easy reference in a new chat or documentation:

**Project Context:**  
You are working through the "JavaScript Everywhere" book, updating its Node.js/GraphQL API codebase for modern best practices (2025). The project uses Express, Apollo Server, Mongoose (MongoDB), and environment variables, with each chapter’s solution in its own folder.

**Key Modernizations and Troubleshooting:**
- **Dependency Management:**  
  - Used `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to resolve peer dependency conflicts, especially between Express and Apollo Server.
  - Installed and managed packages like `express`, `apollo-server-express`, `graphql`, `mongoose`, `dotenv`, `jsonwebtoken`, and `bcryptjs`.

- **Apollo Server Setup:**  
  - Updated to use an async `startServer()` function with `await server.start()` before `server.applyMiddleware`.
  - Ensured the GraphQL endpoint is set correctly (default `/graphql` or custom `/api`).

- **Mongoose Connection:**  
  - Removed deprecated options (`useNewUrlParser`, `useUnifiedTopology`, etc.).
  - Used `mongoose.connect(DB_HOST)` for database connection.

- **Environment Variables:**  
  - Ensured .env is present and loaded with `require('dotenv').config()`.
  - Set `JWT_SECRET` to a random string (not a token) for JWT signing and verification.
  - Used .gitignore to keep secrets out of version control.

- **Authentication:**  
  - Implemented JWT-based authentication using `jsonwebtoken`.
  - Used Apollo Server’s `context` to extract and verify JWT from request headers.
  - Generated tokens on signup/signin and used them in the `Authorization` header for authenticated requests.

- **GraphQL Operations:**  
  - Named operations for clarity in Apollo Explorer/Sandbox.
  - Used mutations and queries for CRUD operations, with authentication and permission checks.
  - Debugged resolver issues (e.g., ObjectId errors, permission checks).

- **Database Management:**  
  - Used MongoDB Compass and shell commands (`db.notes.deleteMany({})`) to inspect and clear collections.

- **Prettier and Formatting:**  
  - Configured Prettier with a tab width of 2 in .prettierrc.
  - Fixed JSON syntax errors in config files.

- **General Workflow:**  
  - Asked and received help on Markdown formatting, code organization, and troubleshooting.
  - Discussed platform limits (e.g., max 50 images per chat).
  - Maintained a positive, iterative approach to updating legacy code.

**Best Practices Applied:**
- Modular code structure (separate files for models, resolvers, mutations, queries).
- Use of async/await for database and server operations.
- Secure handling of secrets and configuration.
- Clear documentation and incremental testing.

**How to Continue:**
- Bring this summary into your new chat for context.
- Continue updating and troubleshooting as you progress through new chapters.
- Ask for help with specific errors, code refactoring, or best practices as needed.
